- smem organized in 32 banks
- this is so a warp can access in one cycle
- single-bank conflict is almost exactly 32x longer -- serialization happening
- different warps accessing different banks? smem can't overlap accesses from different warps
- multicast, same address from one bank
	- broadcast is possible
	- can do arbitrary multicasts at the same speed as it's able to do conflict-free loads and full-warp broadcasts
- wide vectorized loads
	- `ld.shared.v4` load multiple contiguous 32-bit vals from smem into registers
	-  careful hardware load scheduling -- load from 4 banks, but not necessarily in same order
- shared vector loads
	- share same 2-vector of floats?
	- perspective of shared memory: each bank servicing 1 load/cycle
	- each lane getting 2 loads/cycle worth of data, though
	- every value multicast to both lanes, without perf penalties
